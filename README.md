# HANGMAN GAME REQUIREMENTS
## Create your own version of the standard hangman game:
- [✔] The hangman game should randomly select a word and hint from a collection of words and helpful hints.
- [✔] The user must guess the correct word by entering letters into an input box.
- [✔] If the user guesses a letter that is contained in the selected word than the game should display the correctly guessed letters in the position of the word where they are located.
- [✔] If the user makes an incorrect guess, then the program should display part of the hangman graphic.
- [✔] After the user guesses a letter, disable the option so they cannot choose the same letter more than once per game.
- [✔] If the user makes too many incorrect guesses and the entire hangman graphic is displayed, then the user loses the game. Most hangman games allow 6 incorrect guesses
- [✔] If the user correctly guesses all the letters in the selected word than the user wins the game.
- [✔] When the game is over either from making too many incorrect guesses or correctly guessing the word, then the game should display the results (Tell them if they Won or Lost the game) and give the user the option to ‘Play Again’.
- [✔] When a game is over, ensure the user cannot keep guessing letters, but must choose a ‘Play Again’ option before they can play a new game.
- [✔] If the user chooses to ‘Play Again’, reset everything (eg enable all buttons), and start a new game.
